## Complete Tasks

## Stage 1 [complete]

The first part of the project is to build a system that records parcels being dispatched.

### Part 1 [complete]

Users need to be logged in to access any functionality. There should be a **Send parcel** button on the _Homepage_. This takes the user to a screen where they enter the details of the parcel they want to send. They need to provide the following information:

1. The sender's postcode.
2. The destination postcode.
3. A slider to select the parcel weight in Kg, max 20Kg.
4. The name of the recipient.
5. A multiline textbox to enter the full address.

When the parcel is added, the following extra information needs to be stored in the database (without prompting the user for it).

1. The username of the person sending the parcel.
2. The date and time the parcel was added.
3. The parcel status (set this to `not-dispatched`.
4. A unique tracking number (letters an numbers).

### Part 2 [complete]

The _Homepage_ should list the packages added by the logged-in user. This should include:

1. The name of the recipient.
2. The destination postcode.
3. The date and time added.
4. The parcel status.

### Part 3 [complete]

Now the courier logs in. On their _homepage_ they see a textbox where they enter the tracking number for a parcel. This needs to match a parcel that has the status of `not-dispatched` or it throws and error and asks for the tracking number again.

If it finds a match it changes the status of the parcel to be `in-transit`. This status should be reflected on the homescreen of the person sending the parcel.

The parcel details now appear on the courier's homepage but only for the parcels he has entered a valid tracking number. Each parcel on this page has been accepted by that particular courier and not yet delivered. For each parcel they should see the following:

1. The name of the recipient.
2. The destination postcode.
3. The weight of the parcel in Kg.
4. How many hours have elapsed since the parcel was added to the system.
